## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I already knew all technologies used but I realized that I need a lot of practice

### Continued development

I have to implement the mobile-first design in my developments. It was hard for mi to retrieve data from events, so I will focus on that area.
